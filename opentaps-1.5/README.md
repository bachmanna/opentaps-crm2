Integrating opentaps CRM2 into opentaps 1.x
===========================================

You can integrate opentaps CRM2 directly into your Apache OFBiz or opentaps 1.x installation using the files and code in this directory.

For instructions with opentaps, please see http://opentaps.org/docs/index.php/Set_up_CRM2

This code could also be modified fairly easily to work with Apache OFBiz directly, for example in the order or party manager.  We'd love to get your contribution for that!
